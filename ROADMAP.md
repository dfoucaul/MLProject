Let me help you understand how many rows you should have in your CSV file and create a roadmap of what you still need to do.

## Number of Rows in Your CSV File

According to the project instructions, your final CSV file should contain:

1. Guided predictions: (1660, 51) - 1,660 rows from guided_testset_X.npy
2. Free moves predictions: (1540, 51) - 1,540 rows from freemoves_testset_X.npy
3. Combined: (3200, 51) - Total of 3,200 rows

Currently, it appears you've only generated predictions for the guided dataset (1,660 rows). You'll need to process the freemoves dataset and add those 1,540 rows to create the complete submission file with 3,200 rows total.

## Project Roadmap: What You Still Need to Complete

Based on the project outline and what you've already done, here's a roadmap of remaining tasks:

### Completed Tasks ✓
1. ✓ Signal filtering (optional)
2. ✓ Dataset preparation with overlapping windows (50% overlap)
3. ✓ Cross-validation strategy (leave-one-session-out)
4. ✓ Custom feature extraction class (EMGFeatureExtractor)
5. ✓ Model comparison (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest)
6. ✓ Pipeline integration
7. ✓ Predictions for guided dataset

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Feature Importance and Feature Selection (Part of Point 4)**
   - Evaluate feature importances for your models
   - Implement feature selection to find optimal feature subset
   - Document this process with visualizations
   - Create a final pipeline with the selected features

2. **Process the Free Gestures Dataset (Part of Point 7)**
   - Load freemoves_dataset_X.npy and freemoves_dataset_y.npy
   - Apply the same pipeline (filtering, windowing, feature extraction)
   - Train the best model on this dataset
   - Generate predictions for freemoves_testset_X.npy
   - Save predictions to freemoves_predictions.csv

3. **Create Combined Submission File (Part of Point 7)**
   - Concatenate guided_predictions.csv and freemoves_predictions.csv
   - Use `np.vstack((guided_predictions, freemoves_predictions))`
   - Save as team_submission.csv
   - Submit to the competition website

4. **Ensembling Strategies (Point 6) - Optional**
   - Implement averaging ensemble
   - Implement stacking/meta-learner ensemble
   - Compare performance of ensembles against individual models
   - Analyze contribution of each base model to the ensemble
   - Discuss bias-variance tradeoff

5. **More Sophisticated Approach (Point 5) - Optional**
   - Implement either covariance matrices approach or neural network
   - Compare with baseline models
   - Document with figures, formulas, and pseudo-code

6. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Complete notebook documentation
   - Add visualizations and tables
   - Explain feature selection procedure
   - Justify model choices for each dataset
   - Ensure code clarity and quality

7. **Bonus: Predictions Visualization (Point 8) - Optional**
   - Implement the live hand pose visualization
   - Compare predicted vs. ground-truth poses

## Priority Order

I recommend completing the tasks in this order:

1. Feature importance and selection (to finalize your baseline approach)
2. Process the free gestures dataset 
3. Create and submit the combined file
4. Documentation and reporting
5. Ensembling strategies (if time allows)
6. More sophisticated approach (if time allows)
7. Bonus visualization (if time allows)

Focus on getting the complete submission file (3,200 rows) first, then improve your documentation and add optional advanced features if time permits.
